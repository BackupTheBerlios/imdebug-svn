      <blockquote>"The
Image Debugger" is a programmer's utility to
make debugging of Win32 applications that use images and grid data
easier. &nbsp;Examples of such applications include 3D games and
visualization applications, as well as grid-based numerical PDE
simulation codes. "The Image Debugger" could even conceivably be used
to
debug dense matrices. &nbsp; The code is for Windows only for now, but
the Linux port has been started and should be completed any day now.<br>
        <br>
Often when creating graphical applications you have a chunk of memory
that you know is supposed to look some certain way. &nbsp;Unfortunately
debuggers don't typically have a way to view that memory as an image,
and so it's a real pain to figure out whether the image is correct or
not. &nbsp;That's where "The Image Debugger" comes in. &nbsp;The
typical solution -- if looking at the raw numbers in a debugger is not
sufficient -- is to write a bit of code that will dump the data to a
file, which can then be looked at using something like <a
 href="http://www.mathworks.com">Matlab</a>, or if you already have a
graphical app, you can write some code to splat some images up on the
screen on top of the actual graphical output you're trying to generate.
&nbsp;Either way it takes some effort. &nbsp;And often it's a real
hassle if you're working with double-buffered graphics, because if you
want to see drawing as it's happening you have to switch to drawing on
the front buffer, and even then if you're stopped at a breakpoint in
the
debugger and your window gets partially covered, you lose the image.<br>
        <br>
With "The Image Debugger" your data pops up in a separate window with
none of those problems and with just a single line of code. &nbsp;
That's all it takes! &nbsp;You can go from a bare bones "hello world"
console application to visual output with just one line of code. &nbsp;
Basically you can think of this utility as a "printf" for images. So
aside from debugging images, one thing you could use imdebug for, for
example, would be as a really quick-and-dirty front end for a ray
tracer. You write the ray-tracer, then you can make one call to
imdebug to show the results.<br>
        <br>
But debugging is the primary purpose for imdebug. To debug a simple
variable, x, one way is to toss a&nbsp; '<code><font
 face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">printf("%d\n", x)</font></code>'
at a strategic location in your code. &nbsp; With The Image Debugger if
you have an 128x128 RGB image in <i>img</i><i>, </i>you can simply
"printf" it with a call like '<code>imdebug("rgb w=128 h=128 %p", img)</code>'
. &nbsp; For more details see the <a href="#Usage">Usage </a>section

      <blockquote>There are two parts to usage: calling imdebug from
your code, and using the displayer to look at the output from your
application.<br>
        <h2>1. Using The Image Debugger in your code</h2>
The first thing to do is put this in the file you want to debug:
        <blockquote><code>&nbsp;#include &lt;imdebug.h&gt;</code><br>
          <br>
        </blockquote>
The next step is to call it. &nbsp;The one function exported from the
imdebug DLL has this prototype:<br>
        <blockquote><code>&nbsp;void imdebug(const char *format, ...);</code><br>
          <br>
        </blockquote>
That doesn't tell you a whole lot. &nbsp;But basically that's the same
argument list as printf(): a format string followed by a variable
number
of arguments. &nbsp;The operation of imdebug is similar to printf.
&nbsp;The format string contains all the information about how to parse
the rest of the arguments passed to the function. &nbsp;The format
string is basically a snippet of code in a mini-language that I
devised.<br>
        <br>
Before going into the format syntax ins and outs, let's just take a
look at a few usage examples (from testapp.cpp distributed in the
source
zip above). &nbsp;Here are the declarations of the images we're going
to try to display:<br>
        <br>
        <blockquote>
          <pre><code>unsigned char testRGB[16*17*3]; &nbsp;// 16x17 &nbsp;3 8-bit channels<br>unsigned char testRGBA[16*17*4]; &nbsp;// 16x17 &nbsp;4 8-bit channels<br>unsigned short testRGB16[16*17*3];// 16x17 &nbsp;3 16-bit channels<br>float testRGBf[16*17*3]; // 16x17 &nbsp;3 32-bit float channels<br>unsigned char testBigRGBA[512*512*4]; // 512x512 &nbsp;4 8-bit chan<br></code></pre>
        </blockquote>
        <br>
Now here's a bunch of different examples of ways to call imdebug.
&nbsp;Basically the minimum requirement is that you specify the width
and height of your image, how many channels it has, and how many bits
are in each channel.<br>
        <br>
The first example does just that:<br>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>imdebug("rgb w=%d h=%d %p", 16, 17, testRGB);<br></pre>
        </blockquote>
The 'rgb' says this is a 3 channel, &nbsp;RGB format image. &nbsp;You
could also say 'bgr' if that's the order of your images channels.
&nbsp;8 bits per channel is assumed if nothing is specified. &nbsp;The
'w=' and 'h=' statements tell imdebug the width and height of the
image. &nbsp;The actual values could be entered directly in the format
string, like 'w=16 h=17' &nbsp;but it's also possible to use the '%d'
specifier to tell imdebug to get the value from an input argument
instead. &nbsp;Finally the '%p' indicates the image pointer argument.<br>
        <br>
Here's another example
        <blockquote>
          <pre>imdebug("rgb rbga=__gg w=%d h=%d %p", 16, 17, testRGB);<br></pre>
        </blockquote>
This is just like the last one exept for the <b>swizzling </b>statement
"rbga=__gg". &nbsp; This tells imdebug to remap the input channels when
displaying the image. &nbsp;An '_' indicates a channel should be
discarded. &nbsp;In this case we see the green input value will be used
both as an alpha channel and as the green channel, while red and blue
channels will just be ignored. &nbsp;Note that that's "r<b>BG</b>a" not
"r<b>GB</b>a". &nbsp;Originally when I typed it I made a typo, but
Imdebug can interpret the statement either way. &nbsp;If I had typed
the
latter, then imdebug would map the green input to the blue and alpha
channels instead of green and alpha.<br>
        <br>
To specify the bit-depth of your channels use the 'b=' statement:
        <blockquote>
          <pre>imdebug("rgb rbga=gggg&nbsp; b=32f w=%d h=%d %p", 16, 17, testRGBf);<br></pre>
        </blockquote>
The 'f' indicates floating point values instead of integer values.
&nbsp;<br>
Using '*auto' tells imdebug to autoscale (and bias) the values in the
floating point image to a [0,1) range for output. Useful if you're
looking at non-image floating point data which isn't in the [0,1)
range:
        <blockquote>
          <pre>imdebug("rgb rbga=gggg *auto b=32f w=%d h=%d %p", 16, 17, testRGBf);<br></pre>
        </blockquote>
Here are some other examples:<br>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>imdebug("rgb rbga=__gg b=16 w=%d h=%d %p", 16, 17, testRGB16);<br>imdebug("rgb rbga=gggg w=%d h=%d %p", 16, 17, testRGB);<br>imdebug("lum b=32f w=%d h=%d %p", 16*3, 17, testRGBf);<br>imdebug("rgba&nbsp; w=%d h=%d %p", 512, 512, testBigRGBA);</pre>
        </blockquote>
        <br>
And finally here's the syntax description from the imdebug.h.
&nbsp;It's not necessarily all 100% correct or 100% tested. &nbsp;If

          <br>
If you have installed the header file and .lib file where your compiler
can find them, then compiling your app with imdebug should be just like
compiling without. &nbsp;You shouldn't have to do anything special to
get it to link. &nbsp; The header file uses a special "#pragma comment"
to tell the linker to link with the DLL, so you don't have to add it
explicitly to your link command. &nbsp;(Recent versions of GLUT use
this technique too).<code><br>
          </code></blockquote>
        <h3>Using imdebug with OpenGL&nbsp;</h3>
Here's an example of some utility functions for looking at OpenGL
textures using imdebug:
        <p><a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/%7Eharrism">Mark Harris</a>
and I have put together imdebug utility functions for OpenGL: <a
 href="imdebuggl.h">imdebuggl.h</a>.
The main imdebug function in this header is : </p>
        <blockquote><code>imdebugTexImage{f}(target,myTextureID,level,format).</code>
        </blockquote>
There are also functions that read the color, depth, and stencil out of
the current frame buffer
and dump those pixels to the imdebug window.
        <p>The header is for C++ only.&nbsp;<br>
        </p>
        <h2>2. Using the Output Viewer&nbsp;</h2>
        <blockquote>When you call the imdebug() function, the
imdebug.dll launches the output viewer, imdbgdisplay.exe (show in the
screenshots above) and sends it a copy of the image data that you
passed in as the '%p' argument. &nbsp;Once the output viewer app has
the data, the app can make whatever changes it wants; the viewer's
local
copy will not change. &nbsp;(For the curious, this inter-process
communication is accomplished using a memory-mapped file). &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
Repeated calls to imdebug() cause the viewer to buffer up the images.
&nbsp;You can use the GUI to navigate and inspect the most recently
output images. The history holds up to 10 images initially, but is
user-configurable. <br>
          <br>
The main GUI functions are as follows:<br>
          <br>

interesting. &nbsp;There are also many features that could make things
even more groovy.<br>
        <br>
Top on the list are:
        <h3>Known Bugs</h3>
        <ul>
<!--        <li>Non-byte-aligned data doesn't work (e.g. 5 6 5 format images)
[blitters need some tweeking to be able to extract non-aligned values (requires
some bit shifting and masking) &nbsp;A general solution may be tough, but
it would be easy enough to support specific common formats like 5 6 5.]</li>
-->
          <li>The
row stride and column stride settings (rs=,cs=) need work. &nbsp;I
think they're currently broken. You'll have to use densely packed data
for now.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Can't handle non-native endian data. &nbsp;For 8-bit
channels, of course you can just call your RGBA image AGBR and you're
set. &nbsp;But for 16-, 32-, and 64- bit channels there's trouble.</li>
          <li>I'm probably not handling the distinction between signed
and unsigned data types correctly, but I haven't really had much need
for such a thing..<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <h3>Desiderata</h3>
        <ul>
<!--
          <li>The scale and bias settings should be settable on a per-channel
basis. &nbsp;That would solve my dilemma of whether to scale and bias alpha
or not.</li> 
-->
          <li>The
ability to control the channel selection and swizzling from the GUI
would be handy. </li>
          <li>A way to change to other backgrounds in the viewer.
&nbsp;Either provide a larger selection of built-in backgrounds or a
way
to load an external image to use as a background. &nbsp;Often that
checkboard background can look way too much like the data you're trying
to see.</li>
          <li>Allow OpenGL texture IDs as the %p argument and have the
imdebug() function automatically snarf the data for you with an
apropriate glGetTexImage. Maybe same thing for glReadPixels too
&nbsp;so you can imdebug() the usually non-visible depth and stencil
buffers easily.</li>
          <li>"Pixel watch".&nbsp; The ability to click on one or more
pixels of an image and have those values appear in a list.&nbsp; Then
you could see what's happening to a value over time without having to
make sure the mouse is over the right pixel.<br>
          </li>
          <li>A new version of Visual C++ that just has this sort of
image viewing built in!<br>
          </li>

Ported GUI front-end from straight Win32 to <a
 href="http://www.fox-toolkit.org">FOX toolkit</a>.<br>
FOX allows me to handle status and tooltip help more nicely, and
support image load and save. It also enabled me to use nice UI controls
for scale and bias, rather than the cheesy static bitmaps I had that
didn't
respond in any way. <br>
Using FOX also means that imdebug can now be ported over to Linux/Unix
pretty easily.<br>
Some other specific new features added:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>"Link Image" mode.&nbsp; In this mode, when you
drag or zoom or change scale and bias on any image, the same changes
are also made to all other images with the same title currently in the
history buffer.&nbsp; This makes it easier to go back and forth to
compare differences between different instances of the same image.
(Similar but slightly different from the old "Propagate Scale&amp;Bias
mode")<br>
                </li>
                <li>"Replace Images" mode. In this mode when a new
image is recieved with a particular title, like 'foo', that image
overwrites the last image with that title.&nbsp; This way if you
imdebug an image titled 'bar' once early on and then imdebug 'foo' 100
times in a loop, 'bar' will remain in the history buffer, along with
the most recent version of 'foo'.<br>
                </li>
                <li>"Hold on image" mode.&nbsp; Causes the display
window not to automatically jump to the the most recent image.&nbsp;
Particularly useful with "Replace Images" mode.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Navigation by title.&nbsp; Using PgUp and PgDn now
takes you back and forth directly to the previous and next images with
same title, skipping all images in between.&nbsp; Just like getting on
the express train!&nbsp; Using Up and Down arrows takes you on the
"local train" with all&nbsp; the stops along the way (like PgUp and
PgDown used to).<br>
                </li>
                <li>Tooltips!&nbsp; You now get the pixel info directly
under your mouse so you don't have to look down at the statusbar
constantly.&nbsp; You can flip back and forth between two versions of
the same image now using PgDn/PgUp, and if you leave your mouse in
place you can see the change in values in the tooltip.<br>
                </li>

data, which is annoying.&nbsp; Of course you can specify "rgba=rgb_" in
your format string, but you'd like to be able to get the same effect on

and especially Jeroen van der Zijp, for his helpful replies on the
foxgui-users mailing list.&nbsp; I've worked with a number of GUI
toolkits, and I have to say FOX is one of the nicer ones I've
tried.&nbsp; The library has a nice feel to it (even though the
messaging system is kind of difficult to get the hang of).&nbsp; The
documentation is a bit sparse, but the source code itself is quite
clean and readable for the times when you can't figure out what you
need in the doc.&nbsp; And there are a good number of example programs
to go
from, where you often find exactly the code you need to steal.<br>

(i.e.
figure out how to write a straight Win32 C program that uses memory
mapped files to
communicate inter-process data). &nbsp;Thanks also to Willem van Schaik
who wrote "VisualPNG". &nbsp;The image display code in the original
straight Win32 imdbgdisplay.exe (versions v0.9b-v0.954b)&nbsp; were
based initally off of his source code. More info
at Willem's website <a href="http://www.schaik.com/png/visualpng.html">here</a>.<br>

Thanks to the person over at&nbsp; <a href="http://www.codeproject.com">http://www.codeproject.com</a>
(I think!) whose comment about an image debugger got me thinking about
this idea. &nbsp;I got excited because when I saw him use "image" and
"debug" in the same sentence, the first thought I had was that he had
written something like the utility I ended up writing. &nbsp;It turned
out, though, that his program was of a somewhat more limited scope.
&nbsp; I'm not sure what his name was, and I haven't been able to find
the link again since then.<br>
        <br>
Thanks to Andrew Z. whose one followup to my post on unccs.graphics was
all the convincing I needed to go and write this, and thanks to Mark
Harris for his copious and useful suggestions. </blockquote>
